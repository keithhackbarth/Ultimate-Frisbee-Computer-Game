**College Ultimate - Beta Test Version 0.1**
This is just an initial test of the game.  I need big time help with all aspects of the game (drawing higherquality graphics, recording sounds, programming!, etc.) if anyone has time available.  I also need reccomendations on how to actually make the game playable. Obviously, it needs the guys to stack, do world's greatest,stall count,etc... but I need specific ideas such as <what buttons will do what><how to do the graphics>.  I kinda like the way it looks right now but i totally dont like the throwing system.  
email me:keithhackbarth@yahoo.com with ideas, comments, bug-reports; 

The game is only 2 player right now here are the controls:

Team One (i use a gamepad on my computer so sorry if the controls are awkward) - use numpad with numlock on:
Buttons: 1,2,5,3 -> change height and direction of throw when thrower is                       selected, else move selected player.
Button: 7 -> switch players
Button: 9 -> throw disc

Team Two: 
Arrow Keys -> change height and direction of throw when thrower is                       selected, else move selected player.
Button: z -> switch players
Button: x -> throw disc
